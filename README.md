## :warning: App is Currently Incompatible with Backend :warning:

This app is currently incompatible with the latest version of the PhotoPrism backend (to get the latest compatible version, use the [legacy links below](#installation)).  
The status of the pull request with the necessary backend api changes can be seen [here](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/pull/995).  
If you want to use the latest version of the app until this is merged, you can either build the photoprism backend with the patches from [source](https://github.com/thielepaul/photoprism/tree/db-api) or use the docker image `thielepaul/photoprism:db-api`.

Get the latest version of the mobile app including the backend incompatible changes:
